Passion Project: Song Society 


About this application:
	
A social media “twitter” like application for music listeners with integrated Spotify data leveraging the Spotify API. Website will contain a main "timeline" or feed for a user composed of posts. Website will also contain user profile pages that display a brief bio,statistics about the user's listening history, and other interests that they choose to display.
Users:
	Users will register with a name and password to login as well as have the option to link their Spotify account to their Society account. A user will also have the ability to follow other users and view their profiles.

Posts: 
	A user will be able to make posts. Post should fill the purpose of the user to share songs, playlists, and any other music content they wish to share.

Structure and Architecture: 
3 Tier application with HTML and Reactjs for the front-end, Spring framework with Java for the middle or “service” layer, and MySQL for the backend and data persistence.

MVP (Minimal Viable Product): 
	The MVP for this application would include the following: the ability for users to create accounts and login, the ability for the user to create a profile page, a functional feed that displays posts from other accounts that the user follows.
Additional Features:
	Additional features outside of the MVP could include: a utility kit for creating and managing Spotify playlists, the ability for users to interact with posts (likes, replies, repost), profile page customization (profile picture, themes, background, layout choice), a working integrated embedded player for Spotify and Youtube. 

Goal:
	Ultimately the goal of this web application is to provide an interactive website oriented towards music listeners and the ability to share your music interests amongst a network.
